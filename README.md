# CommandLineAutomation
The start of a command line automation project; an auxilliary application for an AI network administrator.

Note: Due to the nature of some of these commands, you have to run the client jar file with administrative provledges.

Network communications with datagram sockets - this makes it possible to send administration commands over a network as well as to execute scripts remotely.

I have been wanting to add full command line automation for a distributed network, NLP based project. This is typically done in Powershell but my understanding of PS is still limmited. However, over time as I get this fleshed out, I will be adding PS scripts along with batch scripts and at some point, linux support with bash. From what I have seen, it won't take long to pick up PS syntax if I am using it regularly.

I will probably not be making a GUI for this as for my own use, I can plug it in directly to a natural language interface. (Administation via voice command!)

For this project, it's mostly a demo of Java socket usage and some basic network administration goodies.

When it's all done, I will probably upload a video on YouTube with a demo of an AI network administrator managing files and processing tasks across a network. Updates will depend on how busy I am. Sometimes there will be a lot, other times it may take a while.
