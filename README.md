# CommandLineAutomation
The start of a command line automation project. An auxilliary application for an AI network administrator.

Note: Due to the nature of some of these commands, you may have to run the jar file with administrative provledges.

Network communications with datagram sockets this makes it possible to send administration commands over a network as well as to execute scripts remotely.

I have been wanting to add full command line automation for a distributed network, NLP based project. This is typically done in Powershell but my understanding of PS is still limmited. However, over time as I get this fleshed out, I will be adding PS scripts along with batch scripts and at some point, linux support with bash. From what I have seen, it won't take long to pick up PS syntax if I am using it regularly.

I will probably not be making a central control interface for this as for my own use. I can plug it in directly to a natural language interface. 

For this project, it's mostly a demo of Java socket usage and some administration goodies. I will leave it up to whomever wants to use it to build a GUI or use some other interface mechanism.

When it's all done, I will probably upload a video on YouTube with a demo of an AI network administrator managing filess and processing tasks across a network. Updates will depend on how busy I am. Sometimes there will be a lot, othertimes it may take a while.
